# React NBA App

This is a website app built using React Hooks and Redux,
The app is connected to Firebase Real-Time Database to save your weight progress.

I'm using [bizcharts](https://github.com/alibaba/BizCharts) to display weight tracker in a responsive graph.

The app is adapted for large screen size as well as for mobile screen size.

Check the live demo hosted on firebase [here](https://playform-weight-tracker.firebaseapp.com/).
